# Python standard library provides a rich set of built-in functions for working with numbers.

x = 47
# a = 'riddhi'
# int() is not a function - it is a constructor for the int type
# y = int(x)
# y = float(x)
# y = abs(x) # i.e. -47 to 47, -47.3 to 47.3
# y = divmod(x, 3) # O/P: y is (15, 2) i.e. 15 x 3 = 45 remainder 2
y = x + 73j # complex numbers are 2D numbers. python uses j instead of i for the imagnary ppart of the number
# y = complex(x, 73)
# b = int(a)

print(f'x is {type(x)}')
print(f'x is {x}')
print(f'y is {type(y)}')
print(f'y is {y}')
# print(f'b is {type(b)}')
# print(f'b is {b}')
